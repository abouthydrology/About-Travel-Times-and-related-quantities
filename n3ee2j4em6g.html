<div>Notationally, in Rigon et al 2016, all these functions were written with lowercase quantities. Before to proceed further it is to note that, when the process is stationary,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V\left(t\right)\ =\ const\)</span> and also&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\forall t,\ D\left(t\right)=F\left(t\right)\)</span>. If we make the assumption that it is<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\forall t,\ D\left(t\right)=F\left(t\right)=const\)</span>, then, in stationary condition:&nbsp;</div>
