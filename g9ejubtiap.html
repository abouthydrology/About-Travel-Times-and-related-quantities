<div>where a change of variable has been made between the second and the third member. The terms inside the square parenthesis are a function of both&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t\)</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t_{in}\)</span> (or in the Nauman's notation of&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t\)</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t'\)</span>). Denoting them as&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(O\left(t,t'\right)\)</span> or&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(O\left(t,t_{in}\right)\)</span> according to the independent variables used. Therefore:</div>
