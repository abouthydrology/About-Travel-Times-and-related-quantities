<div>where a change of variable has been made between the second and the third member. The terms inside the square parenthesis are a function of both&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t\)</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t_{in}\)</span> (or in the Nauman's notation of&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t\)</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t'\)</span>). In Botter et al 2011, all of it is called StorAge Selection function (SAS) and relates the residence time probability&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(p\)</span> to the travel time probability&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(p_D\)</span>. These storage selection functions are usually denoted as&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\omega\left(t,t'\right)\)</span> or&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\omega\left(t,t_{in}\right)\)</span> according to the independent variables used</div>
