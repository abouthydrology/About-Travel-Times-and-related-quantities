<div>Interestingly,&nbsp;life expectancy results as expressed by the forward probability distribution function, the one which, under simplifications was used since the 1930s of the las century to express, in hydrology,&nbsp; the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH). In this case, however, the IUH was usually taken as time-invariant, and (20) represents its generalisation. For those who miss it,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R\)</span> is know just if we make strong assumptions about the future. From (13) and (16) it is clear in fact, that we should know all the inputs still to come to get constructively the forward probability. Otherwise, the approach followed in the past was to assume a form of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(p\)</span> directly, as chosen from one of the known distribution function families, and verify a-posteriore its fitting to data.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="239717" class="ltx_title_section">Determination of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R\left(t,t'\right)\)</span></h1>
