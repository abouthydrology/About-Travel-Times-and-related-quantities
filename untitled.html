<div>This is to look for a unification of concepts developed in theory.&nbsp; Our reference work is&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hydrology}</cite> however, this matter has been developed since the sixties in Chemical engineering. Notably, here, we want to bridge&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nauman_1969}</cite>&nbsp;to recent work which milestone can be considered&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Botter_2011}</cite>. Let's start with definitions:</div><ul><li><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V\)</span> is the control volume which we are analysing</li><li><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t\)</span>&nbsp; is the clock time, or simply the time, (as measured by a clock)</li></ul><div></div>
