<div>This is to look for a unification of concepts developed in theory.&nbsp; Our reference work is&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hydrology}</cite> however, this matter has been developed since the sixties in Chemical engineering. Notably, here, we want to bridge&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nauman_1969}</cite>&nbsp;to recent work which milestone can be considered&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Botter_2011}</cite>. Let's start with definitions:</div><ul><li><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V\)</span> is the control volume which we are analysing</li><li><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t\)</span>&nbsp; is the clock time, or simply the time (as measured by a clock) which in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nauman_1969}</cite> is called&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta\)</span></li><li>Particles are injected into the the control volume at time&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t_{in}\)</span></li><li>and exit the control volume at time&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t_{ex}\)</span>, called the <i>exit time</i></li><li>Either&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t_{in}\)</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t_{ex}\)</span>&nbsp;can be  random variables</li><li><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T:=t_{ex}-t_{in}\)</span> is called&nbsp;<i>travel time&nbsp;</i>of the particles</li><li>If we take a snapshot of the control volume at time&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t\)</span>&nbsp;particles in the volume will have a&nbsp;<i>residence time&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T_r:=t-t_{in}\)</span></i></li></ul><div>Therefore, after these definitions, we have two distinct distribution to care of: the distribution of travel times and the distribution of residence times. Notably, if we collect&nbsp;outgoing particles  at the boundary of the control volume,&nbsp; i.e. the discharge (or evapotranspiration that we neglect here for simplicity), and we have their injection time distribution, for them&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(t_{ex}=t\)</span> and we are measuring their travel time.&nbsp;</div><div>The definition of residence times opens also to a new definition. Particles inside the control volume can have a&nbsp;</div><ul><li><i>life expectancy:&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T_e:=t-t_{ex}\)</span></i>, a random variable which will also have a distribution. </li><li>Let&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(Q\)</span> be the discharge (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(D\)</span> in Nauman).</li></ul><div>Let's assume then that we can label each particle with its injection time and exit time (because eventually we found a way to forecast future).&nbsp; We can define then, relative to the control volume, the quantity:</div><ul><li><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(v(t,t_{in},t_{ex})\)</span> being the volume of particles&nbsp; inside the control volume</li></ul><div>We can normalize it over the total volume&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\)</span><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V\)</span> to obtain:</div><div></div><ul><li><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(p(t_{in},t_{ex}|t):=v(t,t_{in},t_{ex})/V(t)\)</span> that, assumed that injection time and exit time are random variables is their joint probability conditional t</li></ul><div></div>
