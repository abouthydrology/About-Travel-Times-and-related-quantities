<div><b>NOTE: In the following there is some ambiguity upon which I have to reflect a little. We are going to do the hypothesis of an instantaneous release of solute, this in order to obtain back Newman results. This does not automatically implies that the solvent is released&nbsp;just&nbsp;instantaneously which would require,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(F\left(t\right)\ \to F\left(t,t_{in}\right)=M_0\delta\left(t-t_{in}\right)\)</span>.
